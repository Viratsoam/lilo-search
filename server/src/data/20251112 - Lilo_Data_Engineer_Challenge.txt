Lilo — Senior Search Engineer Assignment
1. Intro
This hands-on exercise evaluates your ability to design, build, and explain a search experience for a B2B ecommerce platform using ELK stack.
You will receive realistic synthetic datasets that include intentional data-quality problems.
The challenge is to demonstrate how you model messy data, tune relevance, and personalize search results for different B2B user types.
________________


2. Provided Datasets
2.1 products.json: Simulates a raw export of Lilo’s product catalog (10,000 records).
Be careful with Missing or null fields, Typos, Inconsistent attributes, Duplicates and near-duplicates, Ambiguous titles, Poor category hierarchies, Synonym variations, Noisy numeric formats and inconsistent units.
2.2 orders.json: Simulates 1,000 historical B2B orders.
Keep an eye on: Existence in products.json, heavy customers, reference missing product_ids.
2.3 Supporting files
* synonyms.json: 20+ common synonym pairs to expand

* categories.json: reference list of clean and messy hierarchies

________________


3. Assignment Overview
Design and implement a search solution that:
   1. Handles messy, inconsistent data gracefully.
   2. Delivers relevant results for B2B ecommerce use cases.
   3. Adapts ranking and results to different users.

You may use Elasticsearch or OpenSearch deployed locally or in a free-tier cloud. You are free to code in any language (Python, JS, Java, etc.) to index and query data.

4. Tasks
Task 1 — Index Design and Mapping
      * Create an index for the products dataset.
      * Define mapping types and analyzers (tokenizer, lowercasing, filters).
      * Explain how you handle inconsistent attribute keys and nested fields, non-normalized units (kg vs lbs vs oz), multi-region availability arrays, duplicated and ambiguous text.
      * Decide which fields are searchable, filterable, or for boosting.

Deliver: mapping JSON and brief explanation.
Task 2 — Core Search Functionality
Implement baseline keyword search across title, description, vendor, and key attributes. Test and show example queries such as: 3 hp sewage pump weir, nitrile glove bulk pack, pvc pipe 50mm, tomato (should return food items), tomato makeup (should return cosmetics)
Deliver: query DSL examples or an API endpoint and sample responses.
Task 3 — Handling Poor Data Quality
Implement a robustness and relevance strategy by implementing with tools you think would help: Synonym analyzer, Fuzzy matching, spell correction, Query expansion, Normalization logic for units and casing, Deduplication, semantic or vector search, etc
Deliver: explanation, code snippets, and example improved results.

Task 4 — User-Level Customization and Boosting
Create ranking logic that changes depending on user or context. 
Deliver: example queries for two user personas and clear explanation of boosting logic.
Task 5 — Explain
Prepare a small and concise doc covering your indexing and search design decisions, key trade-offs made, example queries and outcomes, handling of messy data, how you would maintain synonym dictionaries, category taxonomy updates, data quality monitoring, relevance tuning and A/B tests, etc
Optional: attach screenshots or a simple UI / notebook demo.

5. Deliverables
         1. Index mappings and settings files
         2. Query samples or API code
Short written report (Markdown, Google Doc, or PDF)
         3. (Optional) demo notebook or UI
         4. Any preprocessing scripts if used

Package as a GitHub repo or ZIP with structure:
            * /src
            * /data
            * /docs
